[^1]: As of Roblox Custom Cursor v4.6.0.0, if you open the Catalogue button located under the Settings button, the app will use the GitHub API to fetch a list of pre-made cursor profiles. This feature is only triggered when the Catalogue is used, is completely optional, and is non-critical to the core functionality of the app.
