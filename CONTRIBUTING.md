## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning Scheme

We use a **4-part version number** in this format:

```

G.M.m.p

```

- **G ‚Äî Generation**  
  This is the *biggest* version number representing a major generation of the app ‚Äî think major rewrites, big architecture changes, or fundamental shifts. It changes rarely, signaling significant milestones.

- **M.m.p ‚Äî Semantic Versioning (SemVer) equivalent**  
  The last three numbers follow the familiar SemVer pattern:  
  - **M** = Major (breaking changes within the current generation)  
  - **m** = Minor (new features, backward compatible)  
  - **p** = Patch (bug fixes and minor tweaks)

> **Note:**  
> Older versions used the standard 3-part SemVer (e.g. 1.2.3) without a Generation number.  
> Due to migration challenges, the 4-part versioning scheme was introduced starting at version 3.4.0.2 for all intents and purposes.

### Example

Version `3.4.5.1` means:  
- Generation 3 (big architectural era)  
- SemVer 4.5.1 (major=4, minor=5, patch=1)

This lets us clearly mark big leaps with Generation while keeping familiar SemVer for everyday releases.

Please use this format when updating versions in project files and release notes!

## üìÅ Roblox Custom Cursor File Extensions

Roblox Custom Cursor defines and uses several custom file extensions to structure its runtime and launcher behavior:

| Extension | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.rcur`   | `Roblox Custom Cursor Profile` file. Contains three cursor images in base64 (Arrow Far, Arrow, I-Beam) assigned to specific rows. Double-clicking directly imports the profile without opening the main app. |
| `.rccapp` | `Roblox Custom Cursor Application File` file. A renamed Python `.pyw` script used to run Roblox Custom Cursor using the official embedded Python 3.x runtime for RCC3.                                       |

These are handled in the following ways:

* `.rcur` is associated with `rcur_importer_launcher.exe`, which launches `rcur_importer.rccapp` with the double-clicked file as an argument, using the embedded Python runtime for RCC3.
* `.rccapp` is a runnable Roblox Custom Cursor Python application. **It is essentially a `.pyw` file** configured to run using the embedded Python runtime for RCC3 located in `app/python/`.

### üîí `.rcur` Safety & Format Integrity

The `.rcur` file format is designed to be **simple, transparent, and safe ‚Äî even when used from external sources**. It contains exactly three lines of base64-encoded PNG image data and **no embedded logic, scripting, or metadata**.

* **All import behavior is strictly controlled by the main application (`Roblox Custom Cursor.rccapp`) and default importer (`rcur_importer.rccapp`)**, not by the `.rcur` file itself.
* **`.rcur` files must never contain code, commands, or runtime instructions.**
* This makes `.rcur` files passive, static containers ‚Äî similar in risk profile to image or plain text files.

> ‚úÖ Because the import logic does not interpret code or run dynamic input, `.rcur` files are safe to use from untrusted or external sources.

**Contributor expectation:**
If you're modifying or extending the importer, you must ensure it continues to treat `.rcur` strictly as image data ‚Äî never as a source of logic or executable behavior. Avoid functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, or any pattern that parses or executes arbitrary text.

Maintaining this design guarantees that `.rcur` files remain safe, portable, and interoperable in all environments.

### üîÑ File Execution Pipeline

To ensure consistency, security, and compatibility, `.rcur` and `.rccapp` files follow a **strict and predictable execution pipeline**. All paths in registry key values are expected to be **absolute** and refer to the user installation directory of Roblox Custom Cursor.

#### `.rccapp` Execution (Roblox Custom Cursor Application File)

When a `.rccapp` file is run (e.g. `Roblox Custom Cursor.rccapp`), the expected execution pipeline looks something like:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Xelvanta Softworks\Roblox Custom Cursor\python\pythonw.exe" "%1"
```

This runs the `.rccapp` Python script silently using the embedded Python interpreter installed with RCC3.

#### `.rcur` Execution (Roblox Custom Cursor Profile)

When a `.rcur` file is double-clicked or opened, the expected execution pipeline looks something like:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Xelvanta Softworks\Roblox Custom Cursor\python\pythonw.exe" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Xelvanta Softworks\Roblox Custom Cursor\rcur_importer.rccapp" "%1"
```

This ensures that:

* The importing logic is centralized and controlled.
* The `.rcur` file is treated as a **read-only data input**.
* No part of the system executes user-provided logic from the `.rcur` file.

> ‚úÖ `Program Files (x86)` is the default installation location. However, users may choose a different path during installation. All references should the user-installed location.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Requirements

### üì¶ Installing Python Libraries for the Embedded Interpreter

If you want to add Python packages like `Pillow` to the official embedded Python runtime for RCC3, **you must install them into the `app/python/Lib/site-packages` folder** manually.

Use the following `pip` command to do this:

```bash
pip install --target=app/python/Lib/site-packages pillow==11.1.0
```

You can replace `pillow==11.1.0` with any package and version your changes require.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not install packages globally ‚Äî all dependencies must live inside the embedded Python folder so the installer works out-of-the-box without requiring users to install anything separately.

**Requirements:**

* All Python dependencies **must be installed** into `app/python/Lib/site-packages` using `pip install --target=...`.
* The embedded Python environment **must remain fully self-contained** ‚Äî no global Python or pip dependencies should be required. Confirm that **no manual user installation** is needed post-setup.
* If you add new packages, ensure the app continues to run **error-free** using only the embedded interpreter.
* You **are expected to commit** the `Lib/` folder (this directory is **not excluded** by `.gitignore`).

### üì¶ Inno Setup Installer (`RCC3_Installer.iss`)

The main installer for the project is written in Inno Setup 6.4+ and:

* Must be located at: `app/RCC3_Installer.iss`
* Uses `rcur_importer_launcher.exe` and other local assets during packaging
* Should be tested with the official **Inno Setup Compiler v6.4 or newer**

**Requirements:**

* The installer **must compile without errors** and behave correctly during the setup wizard.
* The installer output directory **must be set to the same directory as the script** (i.e., `OutputDir=.`) so the compiled installer `.exe` is created inside `app/`.
* The resulting `.exe` installer **must not be committed** to the repository (it's excluded via `.gitignore`)
* CI will handle building and hashing automatically during deployment
